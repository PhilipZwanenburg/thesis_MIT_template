\chapter{The DPG Methodology}

In comparison to discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, the most noteworthy characteristic of the Discontinuous
Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methodology is that the optimal (to be defined below) test space is computed based on the
minimization of the residual in a specified norm instead of simply being chosen to be the same as the trial space.
Following Demkowicz et al.~\cite{Demkowicz2017}, note that DPG is generally referred to as a methodology, as opposed to
a method, as different methods are obtained depending on the choice of inner product in the test space.
