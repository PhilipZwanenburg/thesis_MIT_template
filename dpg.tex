\chapter{The DPG Methodology}

In comparison to discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, the most noteworthy characteristic of the Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methodology is that the optimal (to be defined below) test space is computed based on the minimization of the residual in a specified norm instead of simply being chosen to be the same as the trial space.
