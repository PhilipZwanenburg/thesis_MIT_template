\chapter{The DPG Methodology}

In comparison to discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, the noteworthy characteristic of the Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin
(DPG) methodology is that the optimal (to be defined below) test space is computed based on the minimization of the
residual in a specified norm instead of simply being chosen to be the same as the trial space.  Following Demkowicz et
al.~\cite{Demkowicz2017}, DPG is generally referred to as a methodology, as opposed to a method, as different methods
are obtained depending on the choice of inner product in the test space. As it is heavily relied on in the following
presentation, it may be assumed that all spaces considered are Hilbert spaces.
