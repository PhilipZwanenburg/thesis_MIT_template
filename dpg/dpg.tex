\chapter{The DPG Methodology for Linear PDEs}
\label{sec:dpg_linear}

In comparison to discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, the noteworthy characteristic of the Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin
(DPG) methodology is that the optimal (to be defined below) test space is computed based on the minimization of the
residual in a specified norm instead of simply being chosen to be the same as the trial space.  Following Demkowicz et
al.~\cite{Demkowicz2017}, DPG is generally referred to as a methodology, as opposed to a method, as different methods
are obtained depending on the choice of inner product in the test space. As it is heavily relied on throughout the
presentation, it is assumed that all spaces considered are Hilbert spaces.
\\~

We first outline the basic concepts of DPG methods in an abstract linear functional setting and then
provide a concrete example through the application of the theory to the linear advection equation.
