\section{A Concrete Example: Linear Advection}

Consider the steady linear advection equation as a model problem
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
& \varv{b} \cdot \nabla \vars{u} = s && \text{in}\ \Omega, \label{eq:linear_advection_omega} \\
& u = u_{\Gamma^{\text{i}}}\ && \text{on}\ \Gamma^{\text{i}} \coloneqq \{ \varv{x} \in \partial\Omega : \varv{\hat{n}} \cdot \vect{b} < 0 \},
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $\varv{b}$ is the advection velocity and $\varv{\hat{n}}$ is the outward pointing normal vector. Partitioning the
domain into non-overlapping volumes, $\fe{V}$, with faces, $\fe{F} \coloneqq \partial
\fe{V}$,~\eqref{eq:linear_advection_omega} is multiplied by a test function $v$ and integrated by parts to give the
bilinear and linear forms
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:variational_form_advection}
\begin{align}
b(v,\varg{u}) 
=\ & \sum_{\fe{V}}
\int_{\fe{V}} - \nabla v \cdot \varv{b} u\ d\fe{V} +
\int_{\fe{F} \setminus \Gamma^{\text{i}}} v f^*\ d\fe{F}, \label{eq:bilinear_pg_advection} \\
l(v)
=\ & \sum_{\fe{V}} \int_{\fe{V}} v s\ d\fe{V} + \int_{\fe{F} \cap \Gamma^{\text{i}}} v f_{\Gamma^{\text{i}}}\ d\fe{F},
\label{eq:bilinear_pg_advection_l}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $f_{\Gamma^{\text{i}}} = \varv{\hat{n}} \cdot \varv{b} u_{\Gamma^{\text{i}}}$ and where the single-valued trace
normal fluxes, $f^* \coloneqq \varv{\hat{n}} \cdot \varv{b} u|_{\fe{F}}$, have been introduced as part of the group
variable $\varg{u} \coloneqq (u,f^*)$. The selection of $f^*$ instead of $u^*$ as the trace unknown is made because of
the possible degeneration of $\varv{\hat{n}} \cdot \varv{b}$. ~\eqref{eq:bilinear_pg_advection}
and~\eqref{eq:bilinear_pg_advection_l} can be expressed more
compactly as
\begin{align} \label{eq:bilinear_pg_advection_jump}
b(v,\varg{u}) 
=\ & \sum_{\fe{V}} \int_{\fe{V}} - \nabla v \cdot \varv{b} u\ d\fe{V}
+ \frac{1}{2} \int_{\fe{F}} \jump{v} f^*\ d\fe{F}, \\
l(v)
=\ & \sum_{\fe{V}} \int_{\fe{V}} v s\ d\fe{V},
\end{align}

after introducing the \textit{jump} operator, $\jump{v} = v^- - v^+ $, with ``$-$'' and ``$+$'' referring to the
volumes adjacent to the face with the normal vector pointing outwards/inwards, respectively, and with the additional
specification of $v^+ = \pm v^-$ on inflow/outflow boundaries, respectively. Following the motivation of pursuing norms
where the continuity and inf-sup constants are equal, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can be applied
to~\eqref{eq:bilinear_pg_advection_jump} to obtain
% Cauchy-Swarz: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality
\begin{align} \label{eq:cauchy_scwarz_advection}
b(v,\varg{u})
\le\ & \sum_{\fe{V}}
|| - \nabla v \cdot \varv{b} ||_{L^2(\fe{V})} || u ||_{L^2(\fe{V})}
+
\frac{1}{2} ||\jump{v}||_{L^2(\fe{F})} ||f^*||_{L^2(\fe{F})} \\
\le\ &
\underbrace{\left(
\sum_{\fe{V}} || - \nabla v \cdot \varv{b} ||^2_{L^2(\fe{V})} + \frac{1}{2} ||\jump{v}||^2_{L^2(\fe{F})}
\right)^\frac{1}{2}}_{||v||_\fspace{V}}
\times
\underbrace{\left(
\sum_{\fe{V}} || u ||^2_{L^2(\fe{V})} + \frac{1}{2} ||f^*||^2_{L^2(\fe{F})}
\right)^\frac{1}{2}}_{||u||_\fspace{U}}.
\end{align}
% Note that the above is a norm on $\fspace{V}$ because constants are accounted for by the trace term.

Above, $\varg{u} \in \fspace{U} = L^2(\Omega_h) \times L^2(\Gamma^+_h)$, and $v \in \fspace{V} = H^1_\vect{b}(\Omega_h)$
where the $h$ subscripts denote discretization, $\Gamma^+_h$ is the union of all faces including those of the boundary
and the internal skeleton, and where the spaces are defined according to
\begin{align}
L^2(\Omega_h)
=\ & \{ u : u \in L^2(\fe{V})\ \forall \fe{V} \in \Omega_h \}, \\
L^2(\Gamma^+_h)
=\ & \{ \hat{u} : \hat{u} \in L^2(\fe{F})\ \forall \fe{V} \in \Omega_h \}, \\
H^1_{\vect{b}}(\Omega_h)
=\ & \{ v : v \in L^2(\Omega_h),\ \vect{b} \cdot \nabla v \in L^2(\Omega_h) \},
\end{align}

Note that the space chosen above for $\fspace{U}$ implies a weak imposition of the inflow boundary condition, and it is
imagined that a \textit{ghost} volume neighbouring the inflow boundaries is used to achieve this.
Equality in~\eqref{eq:cauchy_scwarz_advection} is attained, as desired due to~\eqref{eq:bui_thanh_2-6}, if
the test functions are chosen such that
\begin{alignat}{3}
u =\ & -\nabla v_u \cdot \vect{b}\quad && \text{in}\ \fe{V}, \\
f^* =\ & \jump{v_u} && \text{on}\ \fe{F}.
\end{alignat}

In general, for basis functions of the form $\varg{\hat{\phi}} = (0,\hat{\phi}) \in \fspace{U}$,
\begin{alignat}{3}
0 =\ & -\nabla v_{\hat{\phi}} \cdot \vect{b}\quad && \text{in}\ \fe{V}, \label{eq:optimal_test_adv_trace_0} \\
\hat{\phi} =\ & \jump{v_{\hat{\phi}}} && \text{on}\ \fe{F},
\label{eq:optimal_test_adv_trace_1}
\end{alignat}

and for basis functions $\varg{\phi} = (\phi,0) \in \fspace{U}$,
\begin{alignat}{3}
\phi =\ & -\nabla v_{\phi} \cdot \vect{b}\quad && \text{in}\ \fe{V}, \label{eq:optimal_test_adv_sol} \\
0 =\ & \jump{v_{\phi}} && \text{on}\ \fe{F}.
\label{eq:optimal_test_adv_sol_conforming}
\end{alignat}

Considering the test function for the $L^2$ component of the solution, it can be noted
that~\eqref{eq:optimal_test_adv_sol_conforming} imposes a conformity constraint on the test space, resulting in a
specific PG method from~\autoref{sec:PG_aspect_of_DPG}. However, recalling~\autoref{prop:pg_subset_of_dpg}, the same
solution is obtained using the practical DPG methodology of~\autoref{sec:dpg_abstract_setting}, and this can be achieved
by \makered{omitting the conformity constraint and limiting the support of each of the optimal test functions}
(\makered{THIS CERTAINLY SEEMS NOT TO BE ALLOWED. THINK.}),
\begin{align}
\support{v_{\hat{\phi} \in \fe{F}}}
=\ & \{ \fe{V}_i \in \Omega_h : \fe{V}_i \cap \fe{F} \ne \emptyset \}
\coloneqq \{ \fe{V}_{\fe{F}}^- \cup \fe{V}_{\fe{F}}^+ \}, \\
\support{v_{\phi \in \fe{V}}} =\ & \{ \fe{V}_i \in \Omega_h : \fe{V}_i \cap \fe{V} \ne \emptyset \},
\end{align}

such that they can be computed in a local manner.

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:test_norm_for_characteristic_test}
Given the localizable test norm (inner product)
\begin{align}
(w,v)_{\fspace{V}} 
=
\sum_{\fe{V}}
(w,v)_{\fspace{V}(\fe{V})}
= 
\sum_{\fe{V}}
\int_{\fe{V}} (\nabla w \cdot \vect{b})(\vect{b} \cdot \nabla v) d\fe{V}
+
\frac{1}{2} \int_{\fe{F}} \jump{w} \jump{v} d\fe{F}
\end{align}

and choosing trial functions from the piecewise polynomial space of maximal degree $p$, $\mathcal{P}^p$,
\begin{align}
\fspace{U}_h = \{ u : u \in \fspace{L}^2(\fe{V}), u|_{\fe{V}} \in \mathcal{P}^p \},
\end{align}

then the test functions can be computed exactly when choosing the following test space
\begin{align}
\fspace{V} = \fspace{V}_h = \{ v : v \in \fspace{L}^2(\fe{V}), v|_{\fe{V}} \in \mathcal{P}^{p+1} \}.
\end{align}

and further, the energy norm for the solution is given by
\begin{align}
(\varg{w},\varg{u})_{\fspace{U}} 
=
\sum_{\fe{V}}
(w,u)_{\fspace{V}(\fe{V})}
= 
\sum_{\fe{V}}
\int_{\fe{V}} u^2 d\fe{V}
+
\frac{1}{2} \int_{\fe{F}} (f^*)^2 d\fe{F}
\end{align}

such that by~\eqref{eq:abstract_dpg_error} and~\eqref{eq:bui_thanh_2-6} 

\begin{align}
||\varg{u}-\varg{u}_h||_{L^2(\Omega)}
=
||\varg{u}-\varg{u}_h||_{\fspace{U}}
\le
\inf_{\varg{w}_h \in \fspace{U}_h} ||\varg{u}-\varg{w}_h||_{\fspace{U}}.
\end{align}

The computed solution is thus the $L^2$-projection of the exact solution.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\makered{Working on it! See the Sage\TeX{} document.}


\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Choosing a norm other than that selected in~\autoref{prop:test_norm_for_characteristic_test} results in a different
induced norm on the solution but which may still result in the solution corresponding to the $L^2$-projection of the
exact solution. This is the case for the norm chosen by Demkowicz et al.~\cite[Section \makeblue{3C}]{Demkowicz2011} for
example.
\\~

\makered{I am still currently confused about why this is. It seems that his norm is such that the test
functions are still exactly represented in $\mathcal{P}^{p+1}$ so that the continuity and inf-sup constants are still
equal and that, because it can be shown that the fluxes are exact, the different $\fspace{U}$ norm is still equivalent
to the $L^2$ norm with equivalence constants of 1 (as in~\autoref{prop:test_norm_for_characteristic_test}). There is
potentially something odd about the argument requiring $alpha = O(\varepsilon)$~\cite[Appendix \makeblue{A}, proof of
item 5]{Demkowicz2011} to prove it as the norm~\cite[Section \makeblue{3B}]{Demkowicz2011} requires $alpha > 0$, but I am
not sure. I will keep thinking about it and likely code this up to demonstrate it to myself.}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
In 1D, this results in the computed fluxes, $f^*_h$, being exact.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\makered{Think on whether the intuition below is still valid when finished with the proof.}\\~
The physical intuition behind the choice of test inner product in~\autoref{prop:test_norm_for_characteristic_test} is
that the resultant test functions serve to propagate solutions taking the form $\hat{\phi}$ from inflow to outflow
volume faces along the flow characteristics (in the advection direction) while simultaneously adding the $L^2$
projection of the source onto the trace basis function lifted into the volume along the characteristics. \makered{(Add
figure).}
\end{remark}


\makered{Where are we going with this?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bui-Thanh2013's continuous method results in the recovery of the solution as the propagation of the boundary along
the characteristics.
\item Using the localized test norm: H1-semi + trace term, the trace test functions computed are exactly those
satisfying the constraints above.
\item Equivalent with DG using lowest order test?
\end{itemize}
\makered{Ask Legrand if he is interested in this result once finished typesetting (and likely after 2D is finalized).}
