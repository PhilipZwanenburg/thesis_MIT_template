Boundary conditions are imposed weakly through the specification of a `ghost' state for elements in which $V \cap \partial \Omega \ne \{0\}$. The following boundary conditions are supported:

\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Boundary Condition & Reference(s) & Comments \\
\hline
Riemann Invariant & \cite[section \makeblue{2.2}]{Carlson2011} & eq. (\makeblue{14}) should read $c_b = \frac{\gamma-1}{4} (R^+-R^-)$\\
Slip-Wall & \cite[eq. (\makeblue{10})]{Krivodonova2006} & \\
Back Pressure (Outflow) & \cite[section \makeblue{2.4}]{Carlson2011} & \\
Total Temperature/Pressure (Inflow) & \cite[section \makeblue{2.7}]{Carlson2011} & \\
Supersonic Inflow/Outflow & & imposes the exact/extrapolated solution\\
No-slip Overconstrained   & & imposes values for all primitive variables \footnotemark\\
No-slip Diabatic          & & imposes $\vect{v}$ and $\left( \vect{n} \cdot \vect{F(\vect{W},\vect{Q})} \right)_{E} = \text{constant}$\\
\end{tabular}
